# What is file-bin?

Filebin is an object, image, and URL host. 

An object host is a place for you to host files and share them with people. Popular ones that exist currently are MEGA, Mediafire, Imgur, and etc.
An image host is something like imgur, lightshot/print.sc, puu.sh, or gyazo. They host images on static URLs and usually have their own screenshot tool.
A URL host is something like bit.ly, or goo.gl (it shortens urls for you)

# Where is you domain list?
You can find the whole list here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iXRg3rKq

# Why are you creating something created (and recreated) many times?
Mainly because we have something called "vanity" urls. What we mean by this is, basically, we have an arsenal of domains you can use. Instead of just something like `bit.ly` or `imgur.com` you can use `*.is-my.world` or `*.is-tra.sh` or `omae-wa-mou.shindei.ru`
It's also compatible with ShareX so you can upload screenshots directly taken with ShareX to it.
