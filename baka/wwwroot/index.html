      <p>
         Filebin is an object, image, and URL host.
         <br/>
         An object host is a place for you to host files and share them with people. Popular ones that exist currently are MEGA, Mediafire, Imgur, and etc.
         <br/>
         An image host is something like imgur, lightshot/print.sc, puu.sh, or gyazo. They host images on static URLs and usually have their own screenshot tool.
         <br/>
         A URL host is something like bit.ly, or goo.gl (it shortens urls for you)
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The difference to all these services is that we have something called "vanity" urls. What we mean by this is, basically, we have an arsenal of domains you can use. Instead of just something like bit.ly or imgur.com you can use *.is-my.world or *.is-tra.sh or omae-wa-mou.shindei.ru
         <br/>
         It's also compatible with ShareX so you can upload screenshots directly taken with ShareX to it.
